## Plantr.

### What Problem Will Plantr. solve and Why?
There are many marketplace apps to connect members of the community to sell/exchange objects to each other. Gumtree, for example, has a "Pots and Garden Beds" section however it lacks specificity, only allowing for photos, a title, a description, weather the item is being sold or sought and the price. 

Plantr. will improve user's browsing ability by prompting sellers to list more specific features including; drainage, material, shape and dimensions.

For example, a user views a pot listed by a seller. The photo does not show if there is drainage and is taken on a plain background, so there is nothing to reference size. The user requires a specific size and drainage but likes the style of the seller's listing. The user messages the seller to ask about size and drainage, and the seller could take a day or more to get back to the user, only for the user to find the pot is inappropriate, the seller is disappointed that they have not sold their listing and a day has been wasted.

### Tasks Allocated and Tracked
Tasks were tracked through <a href="https://trello.com">Trello</a> using colour coding and check lists. Tasks were assigned to cards, most with checklists on the cards to break down the task. The cards were also colour coded to:
- differentiate between code based (blue) and documentation based (purple) tasks.
- indicate required tasks (red) and optional/"nice to have" elements (orange).
- show what tasks relate to features of the app (pink).
- show what tasks need to be repeated daily (yellow).
- show what tasks were completed (green).
- show what tasks I am stuck on (teal).
- show what tasks needed to be reviewed before submitting (black).

Cards could also be organised into different columns/lists:
- To Do.
- In Progress.
- To Test.
- Complete.

Trello also allows for cards to be assigned to specific team members, however this project was developed by one person so this feature was not utilised.
